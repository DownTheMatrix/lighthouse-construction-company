# Project Overview

![Website Screenshot](https://github.com/DownTheMatrix/lighthouse-construction-company-website/blob/master/Screenshot.png?raw=true)

SmartEdison is a fictitious construction firm based in Ireland which specializes in the construction and the maintenance of many lighthouses across the country. The website structure is fairly simple and relies on Flexbox and Grid layouts for CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks or libraries) for the site interaction.
